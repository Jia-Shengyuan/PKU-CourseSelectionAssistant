I have changed the name for this project, please clone it again.

`pre_process.py` is used to extract visible text from HTML content, you can try it with `test.html`. It seems to be that running that code will cause warnings, maybe you can ask AIs to fix it.

`api-call.py` is used to call the API of DeepSeek, note that you need to fill the API_KEY value in code before using it.
